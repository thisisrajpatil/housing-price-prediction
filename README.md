# 🏠 Housing Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project applies data science and regression techniques to predict house prices based on real-world housing data from King County, Washington.

## 📌 Overview
- Built an end-to-end machine learning pipeline using Python and scikit-learn
- Performed data cleaning, EDA, feature engineering, and regression modeling
- Evaluated models using residual plots and performance metrics

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries
- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Pipeline, Polynomial Regression, Standard Scaler)

## 📈 Key Techniques
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data preprocessing & feature scaling
- Polynomial regression modeling
- Model evaluation & visualization

## 📁 Dataset
